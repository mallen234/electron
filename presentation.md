# Case Study: A Collaboration Tool with Real-Time Communication Features

- Consistent user experience across different operating systems.
- Modern, responsive, and visually appealing UIs using frameworks like React.
- Node.js on the backend for communication protocols, user sessions, and real-time data.
- Node.js integration enables features like file uploading/downloading, network connectivity checks, and desktop notifications.

# Under the hood

### What is happening when you run "electron ."

---

1. **Initialisation:**
   - Electron initialises its runtime environment, which is essentially a combination of Chromium and Node.js.
   - Chromium is the open-source browser project that Google Chrome is based on.
   - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side.
2. **Main Process:**
   - Electron applications have a main process, which is essentially the entry point for the application.
   - The main process is responsible for creating and managing application windows and controlling the lifecycle of the application.
3. **Main Window:**
   - The main process creates the main window for your application.
   - This window is an instance of a Chromium browser window that will render your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript content.

### Main vs Renderer process

- Electron's main process is a Node.js environment that has full operating system access. You can access Node.js built in features as well as any imported packages. (BACKEND)
- Electrons renderer process runs web pages and do not run Node.js by default for security reasons. (FRONTEND)
- To bridge Electron's different process types together, we will need to use a special script called aÂ **preload**.
